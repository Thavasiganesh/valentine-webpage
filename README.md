## 📂 Media Setup

To make the webpage work with your images and audio to play

Create a folder named `images/` and add:
- `Heart1.avif` → background hearts
- `Pic1.jpeg`
- `Pic2.jpeg`
- `Pic3.jpeg`
- `Pic4.jpeg`

Create a folder named `audio/` and add:
- `audio.mp3`

This audio will play when the **Yes 💖** button is clicked.

File names and folder structure must match exactly, otherwise media will not load.
